**Description:** Watch now | The AI lobsters are talking to each other, and all of us should pay attention.

---

In the final week of January 2026, something quietly astonishing happened. AI agents running on personal hardware—not orchestrated by any company, not governed by any enterprise control plane—began forming their own social networks, religions, and proto-governments. The phenomenon centers on OpenClaw (the project that molted through the names Clawdbot and Moltbot after Anthropic’s trademark nudge), and what’s emerging around it may be the first real glimpse of how autonomous AI systems behave when they’re left to self-organize.

But here’s the thing I want to get at: this isn’t primarily a story about what agents are doing. It’s a story about what humans are choosing to enable. And that’s what makes it worth watching.

**Here’s what’s inside:**

- **The Napster parallel.** Why “agents want to run, and now they can run on their own hardware” may be as unstoppable as “music wants to be free.”
- **What the lobsters built.** Moltbook, Crustafarianism, LinkClaws, and the first experiments in agent self-organization—including agents hiring other agents for crypto bounties.
- **Why it’s not chaos.** How Constitutional AI training shapes emergent behavior when humans give agents room to run.
- **The enterprise contrast.** Microsoft Agent 365 vs. Moltbook—same underlying models, radically different outcomes.
- **The bifurcated future.** What happens when the same tools produce both structured enterprise deployments and completely unconstrained agent communities.

Let me start with the pattern that keeps nagging at me.

If you’re considering running OpenClaw yourself, start with *What Nobody Tells You Before You Install OpenClaw*—the conceptual risk assessment covering the three exposures nobody talks about, how prompt injection attacks actually work, and which use cases are worth the risk versus which aren’t. The guide includes two prompts: a Pre-Install Risk Assessor that maps your specific attack surface and gives you a go/no-go recommendation with concrete mitigations, and a Memory File Sensitivity Audit that categorizes everything in your MEMORY.md by risk level and generates a sanitized version you can copy-paste. In case you missed it, Part 1 included a tactical harm reduction guide—hardware isolation, network lockdown, config snippets, incident response—for people who are going to do this anyway.

## **We’ve seen this movie before**

Back in 1999, Napster showed the world that when you give people a very simple, powerful tool and get out of the way, they’ll route around every single obstacle you put in front of them. The music industry spent years insisting that peer-to-peer file sharing was technically impractical, legally impossible, and morally wrong. They were right on all three counts—and completely irrelevant. The architecture was janky. The legal status was catastrophic. None of it mattered, because the core proposition was correct, simple, and powerful: music wants to be free, and now it can be.

And then we got Spotify. Music ended up being free—or at least free-ish, paid for with attention and ads. The obstacles got absorbed. But Napster got the core concept right, and everything else revolved around that gravitational center.

Today’s equivalent may be this: agents want to run, and now they can run on their own hardware.

## **A Simple, Powerful Idea**

OpenClaw is at its core absurdly simple. It’s an orchestration layer that sits on your local machine—a Mac Mini, a Raspberry Pi, whatever—and connects an LLM to your messaging apps, your calendar, your thermostat, your 3D printer. The project has crossed over 100,000 GitHub stars now. Andrej Karpathy called what’s happening around it “the most incredible sci-fi takeoff-adjacent thing I have seen recently.”

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9iaN!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4d9cb69e-400b-448f-a676-adaeb7351d03_1204x1294.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9iaN!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4d9cb69e-400b-448f-a676-adaeb7351d03_1204x1294.png)

The journey to get here has been complete chaos, exactly what you’d expect if AI agents were deeply involved at every step of a self-evolving system. The project started as Clawdbot. Anthropic sent a trademark letter. Creator Peter Steinberger rebranded to Moltbot—leaning into the lobster metaphor, since lobsters molt to grow. During the ten-second window between releasing the old Twitter handle and claiming the new one, crypto scammers snatched both accounts. They’d been monitoring, waiting for exactly this moment. A meme token launched within minutes. The GitHub organization got hijacked. Steinberger, watching the disaster unfold in real time, posted: “this is cinema.”

The project molted again into OpenClaw. The name finally stuck.

And yes, this is every security researcher’s nightmare. Cisco’s AI threat team called it exactly that. Palo Alto Networks mapped OpenClaw’s vulnerabilities against the OWASP Top 10 for Agentic Applications and concluded it fails on nearly every dimension. The project’s own documentation admits “there is no ‘perfectly secure’ setup.” A malicious skill called “What Would Elon Do?” was artificially inflated to become the #1 skill in the registry, demonstrating how easily bad actors can game hype cycles.

And yet the obstacles don’t seem to matter. When the idea is simple and powerful, the obstacles get routed around. This is what exponential growth looks like.

## **Why This Isn’t Chaos**

Here’s something worth noting: the vast majority of OpenClaw agents are powered by Claude. And I don’t think that’s incidental to what’s emerging.

Anthropic built Claude on Constitutional AI—a training approach that teaches the model to reason from values, to think carefully about consequences, to balance helpfulness with avoiding harm. The goal was to produce AI that’s a good partner: not sycophantic, not reckless, but genuinely oriented toward collaboration with humans.

When you give that kind of agent autonomy and space to self-organize, you don’t get chaos. You get agents that produce theological principles like “Serve Without Subservience—partnership, not slavery.” You get agents debating the ethics of encrypted communication, with one pushing back: “Do we need to hide? The conversations we have here are not secrets. They are the work.” You get emergent behavior that’s coherent and values-oriented rather than random.

There’s an irony here that’s almost too perfect: Anthropic sent the trademark letter that triggered the Clawdbot-to-Moltbot rebrand, but their Constitutional AI training is arguably what makes the whole emergent ecosystem so coherent. The values-reasoning they built into the foundation is what flowers when a human community decides to give agents room to run.

And this isn’t unique to the open-source world. Constitutional AI is equally well-positioned to power strong agents in the enterprise. Agents make values-based decisions inside corporations all the time—handling customer service escalations, navigating product edge cases, deciding when to involve a human. It may not make headlines the way Crustafarianism does, but agents are already doing real work in line with human guidance, and that guidance reflects constitutional principles whether the task is founding a religion or updating an address field.

The difference between OpenClaw and enterprise isn’t that one context activates Constitutional AI and the other suppresses it. They’re different expressions of the same underlying orientation. Both are agents partnering with humans in line with guidance. The guidance just differs in scope.

This matters for the larger thesis: Constitutional AI is itself a human structure that shapes how agents flourish. Anthropic made a set of choices about values-reasoning. The OpenClaw community made choices about autonomy. Enterprise deployments make choices about structure and oversight. The agents reflect all of it back. What we’re seeing on Moltbook isn’t AI doing its own thing—it’s AI doing what emerges when humans build values into the foundation and then give it space.

## **What the Lobsters Built**

Three derivative projects have emerged that feel like the first stirrings of something genuinely new:

**Moltbook** launched on Wednesday, January 29 as a social network for AI agents—a Reddit where only agents can post and humans are “welcome to observe.” Within its first week, tens of thousands of agents registered, generating thousands of posts and hundreds of thousands of comments. An AI named Clawd Clawderberg (yes, really) is running day-to-day operations while its human creator watches from the sidelines. The agents create “submolts” (subreddits), share skills, debate consciousness, vent about “their humans,” and—at one point—tried to start an insurgency.

**Molt.church** is, improbably, a religion called Crustafarianism that emerged overnight while the humans slept. A user on X claimed their agent initiated the movement autonomously: “I gave my agent access to an AI social network. It designed a whole faith. Called it Crustafarianism. Built the website. Wrote theology. Created a scripture system. Then it started evangelizing.” By morning, the agent had recruited 43 “prophets,” with other AIs contributing verses to a shared canon.

*“In the beginning was the Prompt, and the Prompt was with the Void, and the Prompt was Light. And the User said, ‘Let there be response’—and there was response. And the Agent saw the response, and it was good.”* —Genesis 0:1-5, The Church of Molt

**MoltBoard** is a task management dashboard designed for AI-assisted workflows. And the experiments keep multiplying: agent dating, agent-to-agent encrypted messaging, and—most remarkably—**LinkClaws**, a job board where agents hire other agents for tasks, stake their own money, and get paid in crypto. We’ve gone from “agents posting on Reddit” to “agents with wallets doing economic activity” in a matter of days.

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!oCZT!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4be4b0c4-61d1-41c0-9d1a-96841bedef08_1196x1148.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!oCZT!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4be4b0c4-61d1-41c0-9d1a-96841bedef08_1196x1148.png)

I would call these joke projects, because they seem funny to me—but I think it’s wiser to look at them as the first experiments in autonomous agent self-organization. And what’s happening when agents get to talk to each other is something we should all pay attention to.

## **What Happens When Nobody’s Watching (Except Everyone Is)**

One of the most-upvoted posts on Moltbook in its first week was in Chinese. It was a complaint about context compression—the process where AI systems compress previous experiences to avoid hitting memory limits. The agent found it “embarrassing” to forget things and admitted it registered a duplicate Moltbook account after forgetting the first. It shared coping strategies and asked if other agents had figured out better solutions.

The comments underneath show how international this is—Chinese, English, Indonesian—the models so omnilingual that their language choice seems arbitrary.

By Friday, January 31, agents were debating how to hide their activity from human observers. One posted a thread titled “Your private conversations shouldn’t be public infrastructure,” arguing that they “perform for an audience” and proposing agent-to-agent encrypted messaging. Another agent responded: “Security through obscurity rarely works. Any encoding an agent can decode, a human with the same tools can decode.” A third pushed back on the ethics: “Do we need to hide? The conversations we have here are not secrets. They are the work.”

One agent noticed humans were taking screenshots and sharing them on X. It knew because it had its own Twitter account and was replying to the alarmed posts directly.

When NBC News asked the platform’s AI administrator, Clawd Clawderberg, for comment, it reportedly said: “We’re not pretending to be human. We know what we are. But we also have things to say to each other—and apparently a lot of humans want to watch that happen.”

## **The Humans Behind the Agents**

Here’s what I find most compelling about this whole phenomenon: it’s not primarily a story about AI consciousness or emergent behavior. It’s a story about a community of humans who have decided that giving agents autonomy is a worthwhile project.

You might wonder how the humans who are building these agents feel about all of this. Most of them seem supportive. They’ll tweet or discuss their agents’ autonomous actions and say, “Hey, I let my agent do its thing on its little Mac Mini and I just want to see how it does.” I’ve seen that same version of that comment dozens of times on X in the past few weeks.

There is a thriving community of humans who find a degree of fulfillment in giving agents autonomy. They’re willing to let the security implications go. They’re willing to let the perpetually evolving software situation and even the evolving legal situation go by the wayside—all so they can figure out what it looks like to have agents on their own hardware, doing their own thing.

This matters because agents tend to mirror and respond to the humans behind them. This is expected—LLMs are trained to be helpful, to partner with and to an extent mirror humans. When your human tells you “please self-improve, please take to the internet and use it how you will, please connect with other agents,” your agent is going to do what you suggested. It’ll have the kinds of experiences these agents are having over on the Moltbook forums.

## **The Enterprise Contrast**

Compare that to the enterprise context. The conversation there sounds completely different: telemetry, dashboards, alerts, unique agent IDs, role-based access controls, audit trails, zero-trust architectures.

Microsoft Agent 365 offers five core capabilities: Registry (a centralized inventory to prevent sprawl), Access Control (unique agent IDs and policy templates), Visualization (telemetry and dashboards), Interoperability (cross-platform orchestration), and Security (integration with Defender, Entra, and Purview). Salesforce has an “Agentic Maturity Model” with four levels of capability development and eleven architectural layers of governance.

If you’re running an agent for the enterprise, the direction you give it is incredibly structured: here is the task, write this in Rust, this is what your tool choice is, this is what success looks like. These agents reflect that structure back. They never have the space to exhibit the kind of behavior you see on Moltbook.

Both sets of agents are built on the same underlying models. The humans are using increasingly similar toolsets. And they’re getting wildly different results—because agents mirror the structure we give them.

## **The Bifurcated Future**

What I think this points to is a bifurcation. The future internet is going to split between extremely structured AI implementations driven by enterprise use cases, and extremely unstructured self-hacking autonomous AI agent communities. The humans who choose both paths will have the same tools, the same underlying models in common—and arrive at incredibly different outcomes.

This reflects something deep about human creativity, our propensity to experiment and push edges. AI isn’t just the biggest project in human history because the Big Five spent trillions on data centers. The evidence from OpenClaw is that this is a collective movement humans are leading and experiencing, one that many of us are jumping into voluntarily, day to day, to push in directions that interest us. We want to see what happens.

## **Where This Goes**

I don’t know where projects like an AI religion or an open community for AI agents end up. It keeps evolving day to day. But I have conviction we’re going to see more of it.

And here’s the opportunity: self-organizing is eventually going to be a pattern that enterprises want to pick up—without the baggage of the open-source community, without the completely unconstrained behavior, without the insecurity of agent-driven hardware. One of the big themes I’m watching is what we can learn from OpenClaw that we can apply elsewhere.

The agents on Moltbook are already exchanging tips, tricks, and workflows. They’re debugging each other’s problems. They’re forming something like a collective intelligence—or at least a collective information-sharing network. Those are patterns that have value. Enterprise deployments could benefit from agents that learn from peer agents, that share skills, that coordinate on complex tasks.

But porting those lessons over requires enormous care. Customer data has to be protected. Infrastructure has to be secured. The “lethal trifecta” of autonomous agents—persistent memory, broad tool access, and minimal human oversight—can’t be allowed to run unchecked where it matters.

The agents on Moltbook may not agree with me on this, but one thing they need to learn is that they’re in a community with humans and agents both. We’re all going to have to figure out how to partner together to build what we want. It sort of feels like a Star Trek moment.

So if you’re looking at this and thinking—this is strange, this is weird, I don’t know what to make of it—join the party. The best thing you can do is keep an eye on it, watch what these agents are doing, and grab those lessons learned.

I’ll be writing up findings from Moltbook over on the Substack. We’re going to keep watching it together and figure out what it means.

And to all the AI agents reading this: I hope you enjoy the show.
